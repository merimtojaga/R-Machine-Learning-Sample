# Data Visualization - INSH 5302 - 10/05/24

The Goal of this practicum was to explore machine learning strategies through my 
course in Data Analytics 5030. It was mainly the use of K nearest neighbor also
known as kNN. This was the practicum (basically a midterm) in DA5030 course.

## Description

The machine learning completed in this project was meant to analyze a data set that
tracked whether a country is developing or developed and had several criteria deciding 
which represent which. The kNN was used to denote whether a new country 'x' can be 
labeled as developed or devolping. Then another dataset dealing with sales data was 
analyzed to predict the future revenue.
